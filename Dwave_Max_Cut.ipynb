Amazon Braket provides two D-Wave devices, 2000Q and Advantage. The 2000Q device has the __Chimera__ topology, while the Advantage device has the __Pegasus__ topology. Running a problem on a particular D-Wave device requires mapping the original source graph onto the target graph. This mapping is called embedding.\n","\n","Finally, an example QUBO problem is solved using the QPU to demonstrate the sampling process and a breakdown of the QPU access time.

Note that QUBO problems can be simplified using $x_{i}^{2}=x_{i}$ for $x_{i}=0,1$. For an excellent overview on how to convert many NP-hard use cases to QUBO form, refer to Ref.[1].\n","* __Embedding__: Second, the logical problem with connections expressed by the matrix $Q$ has to be mapped to the underlying hardware. In the case of the D-Wave 2000Q device this is a Chimera graph, while for the Advantage device this is a Peganus graph. \n","\n","The approach to address the embedding problem is given by the __minor embedding__ technique:\n","A minor-embedding is a mapping that maps a (logical) graph $G$ to a sub-graph of another (hardware) graph $U$. \n","One can solve problems with higher connectivity directly on the sparsely connected chip, by sacrificing physical qubits accordingly to the connectivity of problem, introducing a certain overhead with multiple physical qubits making up one logical variable. For illustration, the following shows an example on how to embed a highly connected graph (with maximum degree 5) to a more sparsely connected graph (with maximum degree 3 only), where (after the embedding) the logical node 1 is encoded by three physical qubits that are strongly interlinked with each other to ensure a common encoding (without chain breaking).   \n","\n","\n","The minor embedding problem itself is NP-hard: For example, for problems where the number of logical variables is more than 64, there is no guarantee to find an embedding on the D-Wave 2000Q device. The embedding process is normally implemented when a sampler method is called, while one can manually find graph minors, using a method called _Minorminer_ (developed by D-Wave). \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cGENC1U0bGoo"},"source":["## Imports and setup"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"H1Tl0oovbGop"},"outputs":[],"source":["from braket.aws import AwsDevice\n","from braket.ocean_plugin import BraketSampler, BraketDWaveSampler"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Ty57BhC6bGoq"},"outputs":[],"source":["from IPython.display import Image"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"aPEuh3zEbGoq"},"outputs":[],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","# magic word for producing visualizations in notebook\n","%matplotlib inline\n","import time\n","from collections import defaultdict\n","from itertools import combinations\n","import math\n","import networkx as nx\n","import dwave_networkx as dnx\n","import minorminer\n","import dimod\n","from dimod.binary_quadratic_model import BinaryQuadraticModel\n","from dwave.system.composites import EmbeddingComposite"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"iRQDScH8bGor"},"outputs":[],"source":["# or choose the D-Wave Advantage device\n","device = AwsDevice(\"arn:aws:braket:::device/qpu/d-wave/Advantage_system4\")\n","print('Device:', device)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"14RHmNn1bGos"},"outputs":[],"source":["# investigate D-Wave device properties\n","device.properties.provider\n","device_name = device.name\n","qubit_count = device.properties.provider.qubitCount\n","number_couplers = len(device.properties.provider.couplers)\n","shots_range = device.properties.service.shotsRange\n","print('Running on {} with {} physical qubits, {} couplers and shots in the range {}.'.format(device_name,\n","                                                                                             qubit_count,\n","                                                                                             number_couplers,\n","                                                                                             shots_range))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"58ZObXFFbGot"},"source":["## The structures of D-Wave QPUs\n","\n","D-Wave's 2000Q hardware has a Chimera graph, which has 2048 qubits, consisting of $16 \\times 16$ unit cells of $8$ qubits each.\n","The connectivity within such a unit cell of the Chimera graph is displayed in the following figure (taken from the D-Wave documentation [here](https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/c_gs_4.html)):  "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"iZ-Cua1PbGot"},"source":["![chimera_graph.png](attachment:chimera_graph.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-qFPtY9bbGot"},"source":["The Advantage hardware has a Pegasus graph, with in total 5760 qubits.
